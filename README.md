## Sending e-mal with Python
> created using Python 3

The project is based in a help repository, a constants file, a file responsible for send mail (postman.py) and a central file: send.py, responsible for creating the message structure and build other fields of mail (how the subject, mail_from, mail_to and a password).

Make yourself comfortable to clone the project and change defaults values for your personal informations, but remember: dont share your email and your password in public.
